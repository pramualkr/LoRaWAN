Keros 4.3.3: CPF configuration
Since firmware 4.3.x, CPF is installed in Keros firmware

How to configure and monitor the packet forwarder?
The configuration is achieved in 3 steps:

lorad configuration
lorafwd configuration
monitoring and auto-start configuration
lorad configuration
The goal of the lorad configuration is to define the frequency plan that will be used to receive packets from the end-devices, to enable the LBT feature and to configure the class B beacons.

A few frequency plan templates are pre-installed on the gateway (under /etc/lorad/PLATFORM where PLATFORM equal to ibts, wifc, wiis or fevo): it is strongly recommended to copy the expected frequency plan templates in /etc/lorad/lorad.json file. The goal is to keep templates unmodified.
Edit /etc/default/lorad and make sure that the CONFIGURATION_FILE field links to the template you previously copied.
Edit /etc/default/lorad and make sure that DISABLE_LORAD=“no” is present in this file. If lorad is disabled consult the following page to activate the CPF: Keros application configuration - click here.
Edit the template you copied to adapt it to your needs. Since the hardware between gateways is different, the configuration on each gateway differs (although it is quite similar).

Wirnet iFemtoCell, iFemtoCell-evolution and Wirnet iStation

lorafwd configuration
The goal of the lorafwd configuration is mainly to define to which LNS LoRa packets will be forwarded to.

Edit /etc/default/lorafwd and make sure that DISABLE_LORAFWD=“no” is present in this file. If lorafwd is disabled consult the following page to activate the CPF: Keros application configuration - click here.
Edit /etc/lorafwd.toml. This configuration file is formatted using the TOML v0.5.0 language:
Most keys are pre-configured with correct values.
The description of each key is directly written in the configuration file. If this configuration file has been modified, use /etc/lorafwd.toml.example as a model
Hereunder are the keys that must be changed to chose your LNS:
gwmp.node = “localhost”: The address of the LNS.
gwmp.service.uplink = 20000: The uplink port of the LNS.
gwmp.service.downlink = 20000 : The downlink port of the LNS.
Monitoring and auto-start configuration
By default, both lorad and lorafwd are started at boot time. If for some reason, one of the daemons stops, it will be automatically restarted by monit.

The autostart behavior is handled by the symlinks /etc/rcU.d/S50lorad and /etc/rcU.d/S51lorafwd.
The monitoring behavior is handled by the /etc/monit.d/lorad and /etc/monit.d/lorafwd files.
The daemons can be started/stopped/rebooted and monitored with monit. See monit page for more details.

Both daemons are independent. If one is stopped/restarted, the other one does not need to be stopped/restarted.

Log managment
Both daemons generates logs in the /var/log/lora.log* files.

The verbosity of the daemons can be increased using the EXTRA_ARGS field under /etc/default/lorad and /etc/default/lorafwd.

lorad:

NOTICE = -v: Displays start and stop traces
INFO = -vv:
Displays the configuration of the hardware (frequencies, bandwidth, spreading factor, antenna, LBT, …)
Displays the number of uplinks and beacons sent.
Displays TAI/PPS info
…
DEBUG = -vvv: Displays the hexdump of the packets
lorafwd:

NOTICE = -v: Displays start and stop traces
INFO = -vv:
Displays the configuration of the forwarder (gateway ID, LNS, uplink/downlink port, GWMP configuration, …)
Displays the uplinks and downlink meta-data
Displays the acknowledge / heartbeat / drop traces
…
DEBUG = -vvv: Displays the hexdump of the packets
gateway EUI
Gateway EUI is used by LNS to identify from which gateway messages come from.

When lorafwd starts, a file containing the default EUI is generated, based on information included in /tmp/board_info.json.

cat /var/run/lora/gateway-id.toml 
gateway.id = 0x7076FF0039050789
If a new EUI has been defined under /etc/lorafwd.toml, then, this new EUI is used by lorafwd. Otherwise, the default EUI is used.

Kerlink iFemtoCell
Product detail page
Note: These steps have been tested using the KerOS firmware v4.1.6. Please make sure you have this version or later installed. You must also install the Kerlink Common Packet Forwarder.

SSH into the gateway
The first step is to login into the gateway using ssh:


ssh root@GATEWAY-IP-ADDRESS
Please refer to the Kerlink wiki for login instructions.

Install IPK package
Find the latest package at https://artifacts.chirpstack.io/vendor/kerlink/ifemtocell/ and copy the URL to your clipboard. Then on the gateway use wget to download the package into a folder named /user/.updates. Example for chirpstack-gateway-bridge_3.10.0-r1_klkgw.ipk:


mkdir -p /user/.updates
cd /user/.updates
wget https://artifacts.chirpstack.io/vendor/kerlink/ifemtocell/chirpstack-gateway-bridge_3.10.0-r1_klkgw.ipk
To trigger the iFemtoCell gateway to install / update the package, run the following commands:


sync
kerosd -u
reboot
Please refer to the Kerlink wiki for more information about installing and updating packages.

Edit the ChirpStack Gateway Bridge configuration
To connect the ChirpStack Gateway Bridge with your MQTT broker, you must update the ChirpStack Gateway Bridge configuration file, which is located at: /user/etc/chirpstack-gateway-bridge/chirpstack-gateway-bridge.toml.

(Re)start and stop commands
Use the following commands to (re)start and stop the ChirpStack Gateway Bridge Service:


# status
monit status chirpstack-gateway-bridge

# start
monit start chirpstack-gateway-bridge

# stop
monit stop chirpstack-gateway-bridge

# restart
monit restart chirpstack-gateway-bridge
Configure packet-forwarder
You must configure the packet-forwarder on the gateway to forward its data to 127.0.0.1 at port 1700. The file /user/etc/lorafwd/lorafwd.toml must contain the following lines under the [ gwmp ] section:


node = "127.0.0.1"
service.uplink = 1700
service.downlink = 1700
After updating this configuration file, make sure to restart the lorafwd service:


monit restart lorafwd


 /var/run/lora/gateway-id.toml
